# OmniGraph sample node [ft_lab.OmniGraph.GetDateTime]

This sample uses OmniGraph to reflect the current time on analog and digital clocks created as 3D models.

This is a sample project in which OmniGraph custom nodes are prepared with a Python Extension to control a pre-prepared 3D model.    

## How to use

I have confirmed that it works with Omniverse Create 2022.3.3.     
Download and use this repository locally.     

* Assign and activate Extension to Omniverse Create.
* Open "[clock_stage.usd](./usds/clock_stage.usd)" in Omniverse Create.     
References two USD "[clock.usd](./usds/Clock/clock.usd)" and "[clock_digital.usd](./usds/ClockDigital/clock_digital.usd)".

You can now see the current time reflected in the analog and digital clocks.
